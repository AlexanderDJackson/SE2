## TOML Library
This TOML File Library is made to for users to import the library into their Java library into their Java enviroment.

The primary purpose of this project is to make it possible for users of Java to work with TOML files and extract data from within them much easier.

A good show of this implementation functioning correctly will consist of a variety of tests that prove that the code and functions work properly and do what they are supposed to as well as test for edge cases that might break the library.

## Motivation
This project is to create a library that supports the use of TOML files in Java 1.8 and in helping retrieve data from the TOML file. Accessing data inside TOML files is often arduous, this library is made to be a solution to this.

## Code style
If you're using any code style like xo, standard etc. That will help others while contributing to your project. Ex. -

## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech/framework used
-Java
-Apache Maven

## Features
The library consists of TOML Parser that:

-Get keys/values from a TOML object

-Output TOML data in various formats, such as a Hash Table, each data type defined in the TOML specification (DateTime, Array, String, Integer, etc.)

-Mutate the TOML object

-Outputting the TOML object as a file/stream/string

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project theyâ€™ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.
