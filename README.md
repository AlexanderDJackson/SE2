### Peer Evaluation
Peer Evaluation provides a structured process for students and co-workers to provide feedback pertaining to each others work and contributions to the team's overall goals.
The primary purpose of this project is to create software that allows for seamless evaluation of peers and colleagues.
A good peer evaluation system includes things such as how well an individual interacts and helps their teammates, listens to others, presents new ideas, understands and performs their role, and produces positive outcomes of their work.
