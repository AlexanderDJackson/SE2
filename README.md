## Overview
This project is to create a library that supports the use of TOML files in Java 1.8 and in helping retrieve data from the TOML file

## Other Jargon
### TOML File Library
This TOML File Library is made to for users to import the library into their Java library into their Java enviroment.

The primary purpose of this project is to make it possible for users of Java to work with TOML files and extract data from within them much easier.

A good show of this implementation functioning correctly will consist of a variety of tests that prove that the code and functions work properly and do what they are supposed to as well as test for edge cases that might break the library.
