STRENGTHS:
1. Leadership
2. Perfectionism (can be weakness in unhealthy supply)
3. Presenting

CONTRIBUTIONS:
I will lead my team and graciously provide ideas as well as guidance to teammates in the areas my knowledge surpasses theirs. I will keep us on task and schedule to the best of my ability.
I will ensure that my team produces something of value at each and every checkpoint that is as near to perfect as possible for that stage of the project.
I will take the initiative in guaranteeing our presentations, however short they may be, convey the progress we have made and where we plan to take our program next.
